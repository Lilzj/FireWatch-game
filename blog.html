						Creating a Chinese Firewatch logo

						I first considered a Chinese localized name for Firewatch when I gave a talk at GDC China 2015, and they had translated the session title as <看火人> (word for word, this is “Watch Fire Man”). I grew up in Hong Kong reading Chinese, and I thought the localized name was well chosen—because while it mostly suggests “fire lookout” (which doesn’t specifically imply “firefighting”), it also allows a more ominous interpretation of “person watching the fire burn.” 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="description2">
					<p>
						This was long before we had ever decided Firewatch would have a simplified Chinese localization, but the name stuck with me.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="description3">
					<p>
						Jump to 2017. When we began working with Tencent on a localized Chinese voiceover, it was natural for us to suggest <看火人> as the official localized title. We began to play around with the idea of having a properly thought-out Chinese logo to go with the localized title.

						Chinese typography presents fascinating and challenging problems; here’s a great <a href="#">article about the breadth and complexity of the art form</a>. Luckily, we are only attempting to create 3 relatively simple glyphs, all three of which are the same in both simplified and traditional Chinese, so we decided to try to do it ourselves rather than outsourcing it.
						<br>
						<br>
						For reference, Jake, Claire, and I picked out three existing Chinese fonts that we thought were closest to the feel of Verlag, our English font. Claire, who doesn’t read Chinese, made a pretty great first attempt, seen in the lower right above. I’ve never had to think about Chinese characters as a design, but as someone who can read the language, I knew it didn’t “feel” very finished.

						It was fun and educational for me, as someone with elementary Chinese penmanship, to sit down and try to analyze and articulate why some of the glyphs looked like “a kid wrote it.” It was also a fun exercise for me to give Claire, our art director, some direction notes for a change!

					<p>
						Further revisions include:
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>making the middle “Fire” character symmetrical </li>
					<li>making sure all three glyphs take up about equal amount of space</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="chiness">
					<img src="images/bimg/tumblr_inline_oygvyiQIW71sc8fcw_500.png">
				</div>
				<div class="char">
					<p>
						The characters look great now!  Then the attention went to how to resolve some of the harsh points in the graphic, in terms of just the visual design:
					</p>
				</div>
				<ul>
					<li>adjusting the gutter width so they are not identical (yellow)</li>
					<li>making the cut in the shield shape more pleasing (red)</li>
					<li>deciding whether the “Watch” glyph should have “feet” flourishes (green)</li>
				</ul>

					<img src="images/bimg/tumblr_inline_oy1dc7mj2L1sc8fcw_500.png">
				</div>
				<div class="chiness2-text">
					<p>
						By the end of the third day, we’d settled on a design we’re very proud of.  Here is Claire’s fantastic final vector version of the logo. We hope you like how it looks on a shirt as much as we do!

						Love at First Site
					</p>
					<p>
						A few months ago, we got a piece of mail from Ryan (Ryan withheld his last name, even on the return address of the envelope). Ryan had played <span class="fire">Firewatch</span> and, quite generously, turned around and bought the <span class="book">Crime by the Numbers Notebooks</span> available at store.camposanto.com. As a side note, there are many finely made pieces of merchandise on our online store, all fairly priced and ready to ship worldwide. The notebooks, which you can find scattered around the world of <span>Firewatch</span>, are reproduced down to their inside covers to be exact replicas of the type of pulp paperbacks you’d find in a supermarket and then carry with you out to the woods. On the inside back cover is a fake order form for other novels from their fictional publisher, and, much to our delight, Ryan Real-Last-Name-Withheld, was the first Campo customer to take the bait.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes! A compliment and an excuse to spend days on a one-off, never-to-be-reproduced piece of merchandise for a fan.  Our favorite type of mail. Plus, if you’re Jake, you now have a reason to head to Craigslist and buy an expensive large-format photo printer at a deep discount. Should we be working on our second game? Absolutely. Could we spend a few dozen hours of time on fulfilling Ryan’s order instead? You betcha.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let’s see, Ryan Real-Last-Name-Withheld, would like one copy of Mo Marlowe’s <span class="love">Love at First Site</span> and included $4.50 to exactly cover the costs plus shipping and handling. A few hours of illustration by Claire Hummel, a few more hours of design by Jake Rodkin and a little elbow grease in the form of creative writing by me, Sean Vanaman, and voilà, one copy of Love at First Site, ready for our friend Ryan.

					<p>
						A couple things to note: the “order form” itself (again, not a real order form, a prop, in a book that is itself a prop in a video game) is expired. Secondly, Conrad Hummel, the fictional (ie: not real) publisher of the prop book that is itself a prop in a video game, has included a letter to let Ryan Real-Last-Name-Withheld that not only is this the last copy of Love at First Site but, it’s the last book in the entire warehouse. In other words, we’re never going to make one of these again for literally anyone. Unless you’re Stanley Tucci, we would definitely do it for him.  
					</p>
					<p>
						We never head from Ryan Real-Last-Name-Witheld (oh God, I hope he got it) and he never posted this anywhere on the internet so we thought it was time to share it with you. We hope you enjoy the fact that we made it as much as we enjoyed the actual making of it.

						It’s really stunning to be in Henry’s personal space. In fact, while messing around in it the other day, I picked up and then dropped the twenty-sided-die in his desk drawer and it rolled underneath his chair. Then, because I was using the Vive, I had to get down on the actual floor and reach under there to get it. It was an interaction I could never have in non-VR and was pretty thrilling despite this Destination being a simple static scene.

						<b><a href="#">Yesterday we announced that we’re partnering with Good Universe, a LA-based film production, financing and sales company to develop material for games and film, beginning with Firewatch.</a></b>
					</p>

					<p>
						I’d like to talk a little bit more about that, what it means for a Firewatch movie, and why we’d do something like that, in general!
					</p>

					<p>
						Almost a year ago we got an email from Akshay Mehta. He claimed that he worked for Good Universe, a company in LA run by two men, Joe Drake and Nathan Kahane, and that they had made successful movies. (Most recently, the horrifying Don’t Breathe, but Joe had run Lionsgate for years and brought you a few little movies based on The Hunger Games). His claims were validated by Google in addition to the fact that he repeatedly said “I’m legit, bubby!” like a real Hollywood deal-maker. (Akshay didn’t actually say this but I could tell he wanted to.)
					</p>

					<p>
						Around this time, it was right after E3, we were getting a few emails about the future film rights to Firewatch and we kept putting them off. It felt silly to pursue a film deal for a game that wasn’t even out yet and probably could be a stinker. Nevertheless, I got to know Akshay and months later, about four days before Firewatch came out, I was in LA and stopped by to show them the game.
					</p>

					<p>
						Joe, Akshay and the rest of Good Universe work on Wilshire Blvd., about a block from an office where I used to make copies for a pair of producers in college, about fifty steps from Rodeo Dr. and a strong 7-iron from the agency WME. If you’ve ever watched an episode of Entourage, you have seen this stretch of street many times. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Sitting in Joe’s office, I started talking a little bit about what we wanted for Campo Santo as a company and quickly began to hate the sound of my own voice and transitioned into showing them the game. It was maybe 5pm so I figured I had 45 minutes before folks wanted to head home but we spent the next couple of hours combing over the prologue, Day 1 and Day 2 of Firewatch. It wasn’t the first time we’d talked to folks about the story or the game but it was the first time I’d played with anyone and had such a strong emotional reaction. 
					</p>

					<p>
						They understood what type of story we were trying to tell and were curious about the tools we employ to tell it. I’d never experienced anyone in that business have the sort of process curiosity they showed along with an easy-going demeanor that didn’t try to big-time the one guy in their office with an indie-game running on a giant laptop.
					</p>

					<p>
						Conversations moved from Firewatch to the abstract ways Campo Santo and Good Universe could work together going forward. And in the end, we decided that, while developing a Firewatch movie is exciting, and we are definitely in the early days of doing that, in Good Universe we had another company that shared our values and we could call upon with weird and exciting ideas (and that they could do the same). It’s not dissimilar to the wonderful partner we found in Panic Inc. when we set off on this scheme at the very beginning.
					</p>

					<p>
						It felt ridiculous to not pursue a partnership with these folks. It’s rare that you find people who don’t just share your creative values but your business ones as well. Solid relationships are the only way anything in any creative business gets made.
					</p>

					<p>
						So, when will Firewatch be in theaters? Who will play Henry’s hands? Who will do the voice of Turt? For those of you who understand what film development means you a) know I couldn’t say if I knew and b) know that getting a movie made is a tireless process that mixes luck, timing and sheer will together to create success. What I can tell you is this isn’t a situation where we sold someone the rights and they’re off to do whatever they want with with it – anything you see out of us will be the product of a partnership, brought to you by tireless people like Akshay and countless contributions by everyone here at Campo along the way.
					</p>

					<p>
						Until next time. We’ve got convertibles to purchase and sunglasses to don. We’re in the pictures, bubby.
					</p>

					<p>
						-Sean

					The Firewatch Audio Tour is one part devlog mixed with one part scavenger hunt all presented like a museum tour within the world of Firewatch.  We’ll talk way more about it (seriously, try to shut us up)in the next two weeks. But everyone will have it on September 21st or very very shortly thereafter (PS4, Steam, GOG, everyone!).

					Thanks to Panic Inc. and Happymatic, fans could get their picture taken with Forrest Byrnes or even the dev-team if they so desired. Also, Cabel from Panic went as far as to have a bunch of prop walkie-talkies made, surprising the team with them the night before.

					Fans got the chance to play Firewatch on one of Syber’s Steam machines or Cyberpower’s towers. They’re great machines (Cyberpower assembled our dev machines) and they were a great partner at show. Thanks CyberpowerPC and Syber Gaming!
